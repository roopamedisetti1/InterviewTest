The Case Against The Usage Of Instant OR Auto-Generated Blog sites & Web sites
 
The other day I got an email from a big named Guru with
 a recommendation I actually need to inform you about. I won’t state
 any names because he doesn’t always furnish bad information, in
 fact he usually provides top notch information.
 
The subject line was something like ‘PHP coded niche sites
 for 20 cents each?’ and he even stated he was blown away.
 
Blown away? …yeah someone needed to blow away this offer.
 
I have seen some very poor advice and products recommendations
 how ever that one just about takes the cake.
 
Then there is the software package du jour that several Web Marketers
 have advertised called…
 
…well let us not use the real brands. I do not like to
 freely bash a product. Nevertheless, there’s so many which are
 just like this, pointing at one hardly gets the point across.
 
Let’s just refer to it as… “Instant So and So Web sites.”
 
These kinds of software generates web sites that include eBay auctions
 and Adsense for monetization. Others build them based on
 Amazon . com or Clickbank items. You get the drift. Years ago
 software similar to this worked, but not anymore.
 
Next you have other pre-built web sites which include…
 
Wait for it…
 
…Master Resale Rights. Whoopee. Now you’ve got thousands
 of others adding the very same web-site. You no doubt know the ones I am
 referring to with 80 Google adsense and / or 155 Niche Adsense websites.
 
Talk about Worse than Worthless… Why don’t you consider just send Google
 an email and have them to put the domain name you are going
 to put those on in their bad neighborhood checklist, or maybe go
 ahead and ban it from their index?
 
I prefer to keep up with what is happening therefore i took a look at
 just what exactly these products produce and I can let you know that putting
 up web-sites created with these may be a really, really Bad Idea.
 
Here’s why…
 
Honestly there are several reasons why but here is an
 important one. The pages created with it all have the same
 Title tag.
 
How big a footprint is that?
 
It is a huge footprint. If you wish to waive a red flag at
 Google and say “Hey, this is an automated website produced by
 mindless software” this is the way to do it. It is
 better not to create a title tag at all…
 
…however the title tag is really important in on-page search
 engine optimization.
 
Another product like this automatically inserts this
 phrase into the description tag of every page,
 “This site deals with” followed by the keyword.
 
Are you able to say Sasquatch?
 
Think about it. How fast will Google spot that? I’d venture to
 claim that even MSN’s Bing will catch that particular one.
 
For this reason it can be foolish to use generated websites or
 web templates, or a software solution.
 
So what on earth is the solution?
 
If you would like to build an Online Empire
 I have discovered a superior way to make it happen right…
 
How would you like to have ten brand-new top quality, gorgeous
 web sites every month, that Search engines love, working to
 produce an ever increasing income stream on your behalf?
 
In just a minute I will show you an easier way to make it happen, but
 first, realize this…
 
The sites I’m going to present you make good use of the Title
 tag. Every page has, not just a different title tag, but a
 different description, keyword tags, and Technorati tags.
 Plus each one of those are different from each other.
 
So what, some would say.
 
Well that’s one of the things Google searches for within a website.
 That and numerous other important ranking factors are
 incorporated into sites at…
